<!-- # `r fontawesome::fa("user-check")` Evaluation. {#sec-evaluation} -->

<!-- Let's see how your final grade $F$ is calculated. -->

<!-- ## `r fontawesome::fa("users")` Co-evaluation. -->

<!-- Consider an hypothetical group of four students that worked together in their first assignment $H_1$ for illustration purposes. The group mark is $H_m = 90$, and now they have to complete their co-evaluation. The group members are: Bebito Fiu-Fiu, Baby Yoda, John Doe and Winnie Pooh. Every member assigns a mark to the rest using a simple Google Form. Then, John Doe's co-evaluation mark $mean(C_1)$ is the simple average of his 3 assigned marks.  -->

<!-- In case $mean(C_1) \ge 70$ and the group mark $H_m \ge 70$, then John Doe's individual $H_1$ mark is computed as: $H_1=(0.70 \times H_m)+(0.30 \times mean(C_1))$. -->

<!-- Otherwise, the individual assignment mark will be the lowest of $mean(C_1)$ and $H_m$: $H_1=\mathrm{min}(mean(C_1), H_m)$.  -->

<!-- Using R: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- fun <- function(C1, Hm) { -->
<!--   if (mean(C1) >= 70 && Hm >= 70) {  -->
<!--   H <- (0.7 * Hm) + (0.3 * mean(C1)) } # H is the individual assignment mark. -->
<!--   else {H <- min(mean(C1), Hm) } # Free-riders are penalized. -->
<!--   H } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Let's evaluate this function in R to see how it works. Assume this co-evaluation is for the $H_1$ and we are calculating John Doe's mark. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # Bebito Fiu-Fiu assigns 70 to John Doe. -->
<!-- # Baby Yoda 60 to John Doe. -->
<!-- # Winnie Pooh 70 to John Doe. -->
<!-- C1 <- c(70, 60, 70) -->
<!-- Hm <- 90 # Group mark. -->
<!-- H1 <- fun(C1, Hm) # Individual mark. -->
<!-- paste("John Doe's coevaluation in the first assignment is:", round(mean(C1), 2)) -->
<!-- paste("John Doe's individual mark in the first assignment is:", round((H1), 2)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This is because we apply $H_1=\mathrm{min}(mean(C_1), H_m) \rightarrow H_1=\mathrm{min}(66.67, 90)\rightarrow H_1=66.67$.  -->

<!-- If instead of 60, Baby Yoda evaluates John Doe with a 80, then: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- C1 <- c(70, 80, 70) -->
<!-- Hm <- 90 # Group mark. -->
<!-- H1 <- fun(C1, Hm) # Individual mark. -->
<!-- paste("John Doe's coevaluation in the first assignment is:", round(mean(C1), 2)) -->
<!-- paste("John Doe's individual mark in the first assignment is:", H1) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This is because we apply $H_1=(0.70 \times 90)+\left(0.30 \times \frac{70+80+70}{3}\right) = 85$. Clearly, your co-evaluation matters because although the group mark is 90, John Doe's individual $H_1$ mark could range from 66.67 to 85 depending on Baby Yoda's co-evaluation. -->
